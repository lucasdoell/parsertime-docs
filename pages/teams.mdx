# Teams
Parsertime supports creating teams and inviting players to view and manage scrims. 

## Creating A Team
The `Create Team` button can be found in the team selector dropdown. You can view this on the dashboard.

Once you have created a team, you will be able to assign scrims and invite players.

## Inviting Players
You can invite players to your team by email. Navigate to the Teams page and select your 
team from the available options. Here you will see a list of your team members.

*This page also allows you to remove players from your team or assign them as a manager.
As a manager, they will be able to create scrims and maps for your team.*

Click the Invite Member button and enter an email to send them an invite. They'll 
receive an email that looks like this from `noreply@lux.dev`:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You can only send invites to players who have an account on Parsertime.
  Trying to invite a player who does not have an account will result in a 404 error.
</Callout>

Team invite tokens are valid for 7 days. If the player does not accept the invite within
that time, you will need to send them a new invite. Please note that they are also
single use. If the player accepts the invite, the token will be invalidated.

## Editing Team Details
On the team page, you can select the Settings tab to change team details.
