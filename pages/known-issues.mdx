There are a few known issues with Parsertime. We are working on fixing these issues 
and will update this page as we make progress.

## All Issues

### Workshop Inspector Log File not appearing in Overwatch settings
We are aware of an issue where users cannot enable the Workshop Inspector Log File in
their game settings. Blizzard is aware of the issue and we are waiting for a fix.

**Severity**: Critical

**Fix**: We are waiting for Blizzard to release a fix for this issue. We will update this
page when the issue is resolved.

### Juno shows zero healing dealt
Due to limitations with the Workshop, the healing dealt for Juno is not tracked.
Blizzard has not updated the Workshop to support this yet. We are waiting for a fix.

**Severity**: Major

**Fix**: We are waiting for Blizzard to release a fix for this issue. We will update this
page when the issue is resolved.

### Wave Respawns showing Mercy resurrects from an unknown player
Due to the spawn changes in Season 12, Wave Respawns are counting as Mercy resurrects.
This is due to how the Workshop code tracks resurrects. The Workshop code looks for
respawns within 10 seconds of a player's death. Wave respawns are thus counted as
Mercy resurrects.

**Severity**: Major

**Fix**: We are waiting on the log generator to be updated to support the new spawn
changes. We will update this page when the issue is resolved.

### Clash mode showing objective captures incorrectly
Clash mode is not supported by the Workshop code. This means that the Workshop code
will need to be updated to support the new Clash mode. We are waiting on the Workshop code
to be updated to support Clash mode.

**Severity**: Major

**Fix**: We are waiting on the Workshop code to be updated to support the new Clash mode. We will
update this page when the issue is resolved.

### Map winrates are tracking all maps in a scrim regardless of player participation
There is currently a flaw within the map winrate calculation that is causing the winrates
to be calculated for all maps in a scrim, regardless of whether or not the player participated
in that map. We are working on fixing this issue and will update this page when the issue is resolved.
We aim to resolve this for v1.3.

**Severity**: Major

**Fix**: We are working on fixing this issue. We will update this page when the issue is resolved.

### Logs in languages other than English are not supported
Currently, the parser only supports English logs. We are working on adding support for
other languages and will update this page when the issue is resolved. We aim to resolve this for v1.3.

**Severity**: Minor

**Fix**: We are working on adding support for other languages. We will update this page when the issue is resolved.

### Average time to use ultimate stat is not accurate
The average time to use ultimate stat is not accurate. This is due to a flaw in the
implementation. We are working on fixing this issue and will update this page when the issue is resolved.
We aim to resolve this for v1.3.

**Severity**: Minor

**Fix**: We are working on fixing this issue. We will update this page when the issue is resolved.

### Push maps not showing score
Push maps do not show the score for each round. This is due to limitations with both
the in-game Workshop and the log generator. With Overwatch 2's release, the Workshop
was not updated to support the new Push game mode. This means that the log generator
cannot generate the score when the push bot is pushed to the end of the map.
Additionally, there is no way to track the progress of the push bot.

**Severity**: Major

**Fix**: There is no fix for this issue at the moment. We are waiting for the Workshop
to be updated to support Overwatch 2's new game modes.

### Flashpoint maps only containing 4 rounds
We are aware of an issue where Flashpoint maps only contain 4 rounds. 
This seems to be an issue with the log generator. This can lead to some charts and 
statistics looking incorrect.

*The overview page not showing the round 5 stats for Flashpoint maps.*

![Flashpoint player charts bug](/known-issues/flashpoint-bug-2.png)
*The player charts showing only 4 rounds for Flashpoint maps. The charts incorrectly 
show a steep increase in values.*

**Severity**: Minor

**Fix**: The final round stats are visible from the Overview tab. As for the player 
charts, a fix is reliant on the log generator.

---


## Non Issues
### Push maps only showing 1 round
Push maps only show 1 round in the overview. This is due to the nature of the game mode.
This is not a bug and will not be changed.

**Severity**: Non-issue

**Fix**: N/A

---

## Fixed
### Overview stats table showing incorrect player roles
Occasionally, the overview stats table will show incorrect player roles.
This is due to player role being determined by the first character the player picked.

*An example of three players being listed as Damage, when there can only be two Damage players.*

**Severity**: Fixed
