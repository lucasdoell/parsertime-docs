There are a few known issues with Parsertime. We are working on fixing these issues 
and will update this page as we make progress.

## All Issues

### Push maps not showing score
Push maps do not show the score for each round. This is due to limitations with both
the in-game Workshop and the log generator. With Overwatch 2's release, the Workshop
was not updated to support the new Push game mode. This means that the log generator
cannot generate the score when the push bot is pushed to the end of the map.
Additionally, there is no way to track the progress of the push bot.

**Severity**: Major

**Fix**: There is no fix for this issue at the moment. We are waiting for the Workshop
to be updated to support Overwatch 2's new game modes.

### Flashpoint maps only containing 4 rounds
We are aware of an issue where Flashpoint maps only contain 4 rounds. 
This seems to be an issue with the log generator. This can lead to some charts and 
statistics looking incorrect.

*The overview page not showing the round 5 stats for Flashpoint maps.*

![Flashpoint player charts bug](/known-issues/flashpoint-bug-2.png)
*The player charts showing only 4 rounds for Flashpoint maps. The charts incorrectly 
show a steep increase in values.*

**Severity**: Minor

**Fix**: The final round stats are visible from the Overview tab. As for the player 
charts, a fix is reliant on the log generator.

### Overview stats table showing incorrect player roles
Occasionally, the overview stats table will show incorrect player roles.
This is due to player role being determined by the first character the player picked.

*An example of three players being listed as Damage, when there can only be two Damage players.*

**Severity**: Minor

**Fix**: We are working on a fix for this issue. In the meantime, you can see each player's 
most played hero from the player selector in the top left corner.

## Non Issues
### Push maps only showing 1 round
Push maps only show 1 round in the overview. This is due to the nature of the game mode.
This is not a bug and will not be changed.

**Severity**: Non-issue

**Fix**: N/A
