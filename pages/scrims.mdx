# Scrims
Scrims are the core feature of Parsertime. By uploading your map logs,
you can see how your team performed in each scrim. You can also see how
you performed individually, and compare your stats to other players.

## Creating a Scrim
*Please see the [Introduction](/#collecting-scrim-logs) for instructions on how to collect logs.*

To create a scrim, click the "Create Scrim" button. You will be prompted to upload 
the logs for the first map of the scrim.

## Adding Maps to a Scrim
After you've uploaded your first map, you can add more maps to the scrim by
dragging and dropping the logs onto the "Add Map" card or by choosing a file.

## Sharing Scrims
There are two ways to share a scrim. If you have added the scrim to your team during the
scrim creation process, the scrim will be visible to all members of the team. If you have not
added the scrim to your team, you can make the scrim publically available by clicking the
"Edit" button and toggling on "Enable Guest Mode". This will allow anyone with the link to view
the scrim.

### Steps to make a scrim public:
1. Click the "Edit" button on the scrim.

3. Click "Update Scrim" to save your changes.

## Editing Scrims
You can edit a scrim by clicking the "Edit" button on the scrim view. This will allow you to
change the scrim's name, enable guest mode, or delete the scrim.

You can change the name of the scrim by adding a new name in the "Display Name" field.
This is how the scrim will be displayed on the dashboard. Once your changes are made, click
"Update Scrim" to save your changes.

<Callout type="info">
    You are currently not able to edit the maps in a scrim. This will
    be added in a future update. If you need to change the maps in a scrim,
    you will need to delete the scrim and create a new one.
</Callout>

## Deleting Scrims
To delete a scrim, navigate to the scrim view and click the "Edit" button. This will open the
edit scrim page. Click the "Delete Scrim" button to delete the scrim. This will open a dialog
asking you to confirm the deletion. To avoid accidental deletions, you will need to type the
name of the scrim to confirm the deletion. Once you have confirmed the deletion, the scrim will
be removed from the database and will no longer be accessible.

of the scrim.*

<Callout type="error" emoji="❗">
    Deleting a scrim is permanent and cannot be undone. Please be sure you want to delete
    the scrim before confirming the deletion. If you are unsure, you can make the scrim private
    by disabling guest mode.
</Callout>

Once you have deleted the scrim, it will no longer be visible on the dashboard or to anyone
who has the link. If you have shared the scrim with your team, the scrim will be removed from
the team's dashboard as well. You will be redirected to the dashboard after the scrim is deleted.

**It is highly recommended to keep the logs for all of your scrims.** If you delete a scrim, the logs
will be removed from the database and will no longer be accessible. The logs are measured in
kilobytes and should not take up much space on your computer. For this reason, it is recommended
to organize and store your logs in a safe place. If you need to delete a scrim, you can always
re-upload the logs to create a new scrim.
