# Maps

Maps are the individual games that your team plays during a scrim. 
They are the building blocks of a scrim and are the most granular 
level of data that you can analyze. Each map has its own set of 
data that you can analyze, including the killfeed, events, and charts.

Each log file represents a single map. When you upload a log file,
you are uploading the data for that map in particular. This allows
you to analyze each map individually and see how your team performed.
Being able to analyze each map individually is important because it
allows you to see where your team is strong and where you need to improve.

We have the following pages to help you analyze your maps:
- [Overview](/maps/overview)
- [Killfeed](/maps/killfeed)
- [Charts](/maps/charts)
- [Events](/maps/events)
- [Compare](/maps/compare)
