# Stats

Version 1.1 of Parsertime brings a new feature: player and hero statistics.
See stats for a specific player or hero, including eliminations, deaths, damage, and more.
Compete to see who can take the number one spot on the leaderboard for each statistic.

Please note that this is a new feature and may have bugs. If you encounter any issues,
please report them to us. See our [bug reporting guide](/reporting-bugs) for more 
information on how to report bugs.

We have the following pages to help you analyze your stats:
- [Leaderboard](/stats/leaderboard)
- [Player Stats](/stats/player-stats)
- [Hero Stats](/stats/hero-stats)
