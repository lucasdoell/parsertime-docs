# Hero Stats

Every time a scrim is uploaded to Parsertime, player statistics are calculated 
and stored in the database. This allows you to see detailed stats for each player, 
including eliminations, deaths, damage, and more.

This enables the ability to see stats for each hero across all players. You can see
how the average player performs on a specific hero, or how you stack up against the
competition.

Stats can be filtered by a timeframe, such as the last week, month, or all time.

To view stats for a specific hero, select the hero from the hero selector. To access
the hero selector, click the link on the Stats page under the player name input.

## Stats
### Hero Stats Overview

The Hero Stats Overview section shows the following metrics:
- Total Games Played
- Total Kills
- Total Deaths

The hero stats overview also shows the number of scrims that is being used to calculate the data.
Stats are collected from every player that has played the hero in a scrim.

### Best Performance

This category is calculated by the highest **final blows** count recorded in a single game.
You can see the player name and the number of final blows.

To see the player's stats in more detail, click their name to view the player stats page for that hero.

### Final Blows By Method

The final blows by method chart shows the most common methods of final blows for the hero. This is calculated by the number of final
blows for each method across all scrims within the selected timeframe.

Some hero-specific outliers may be visible, such as Wrecking Ball having final blows that show as "Crouch". This
corresponds to Wrecking Ball's Piledriver ability.

### Average Hero Damage Dealt per 10 Minutes (per scrim)

The average hero damage dealt per 10 minutes is calculated by the total hero damage dealt divided by the total time played in minutes, 
then multiplied by 10.

The chart finds the average hero damage dealt per 10 minutes across every map in which the hero has been played. This is then averaged
by the number of maps played within the scrim to get the value per 10 per scrim. This is then assigned to the scrim date.

Each dot on the line chart represents a scrim date. Hover over the dots to see the exact value for that scrim.

### Average Deaths per 10 Minutes (per scrim)

The average deaths per 10 minutes is calculated by the total deaths divided by the total time played in minutes, 
then multiplied by 10.

The chart finds the average deaths per 10 minutes across every map in which the hero has been played. This is then averaged
by the number of maps played within the scrim to get the value per 10 per scrim. This is then assigned to the scrim date.
