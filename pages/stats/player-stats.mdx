# Player Stats

Every time a scrim is uploaded to Parsertime, player statistics are calculated 
and stored in the database. This allows you to see detailed stats for each player, 
including eliminations, deaths, damage, and more.

This enables the ability to see your stats over time. You can see trends such as
improvements in your eliminations or damage over time. You can also compare your
stats to the global average or other players to see how you stack up against the 
competition.

Stats can be filtered by a timeframe, such as the last week, month, or all time.
There is also a filter to select the specific hero you want to view stats for.

To view stats for a specific player, enter the player name in the player name input.

## Stats

### Most Played Heroes

This category shows the most played heroes for the player across all scrims.
This is calculated by the number of games in which the player selected each hero.

### Best Performance

This category is calculated by the highest **final blows** count recorded in a single game.
You can see the hero played, the number of final blows, and the map in which the performance occurred.

To see the map in more detail, click the hero name to view the map stats page for that performance.

### Average Hero Damage Dealt per 10 Minutes (per scrim)

The average hero damage dealt per 10 minutes is calculated by the total hero damage dealt divided by the total time played in minutes, 
then multiplied by 10. This is a good metric to compare your damage output to other players. While total hero damage is important,
it's also important to consider the time played to get a more accurate representation of your performance.

The chart finds the average hero damage dealt per 10 minutes across every map in which the player has played. This is then averaged
by the number of maps played within the scrim to get the value per 10 per scrim. This is then assigned to the scrim date.

Each dot on the line chart represents a scrim date. Hover over the dots to see the exact value for that scrim.

### Average Deaths per 10 Minutes (per scrim)

The average deaths per 10 minutes is calculated by the total deaths divided by the total time played in minutes, 
then multiplied by 10. This is a good metric to compare your survivability to other players. While total deaths are important,
it's also important to consider the time played to get a more accurate representation of your performance.

The chart finds the average deaths per 10 minutes across every map in which the player has played. This is then averaged
by the number of maps played within the scrim to get the value per 10 per scrim. This is then assigned to the scrim date.

Each dot on the line chart represents a scrim date. Hover over the dots to see the exact value for that scrim.

### Time Spent on Each Role

This chart shows the time spent on each role for the player. This is calculated by the total hero time played across all scrims within
the selected timeframe. This is then divided by the total time played to get the percentage of time spent on each role.

### Final Blows By Method

The final blows by method chart shows the most common methods of final blows for the player. This is calculated by the number of final
blows for each method across all scrims within the selected timeframe.

Some hero-specific outliers may be visible, such as a Wrecking Ball player having final blows that show as "Crouch". This
corresponds to Wrecking Ball's Piledriver ability.
