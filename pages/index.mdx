Welcome to Parsertime! This is the home for our documentation. Here you 
can learn more about our platform, how to use it, and more.

## What is Parsertime?
Parsertime is a tool used to visualize the data collected from Overwatch 
scrim logs. You can create an account, form a team, upload your scrims, and 
invite your team to view their data. You can see graphs for damage, eliminations, 
fights, and view data and statistics for both teams and individual players. 

## Collecting Scrim Logs
To gather your data, you must first turn on *Gameplay > Enable Workshop Inspector 
Log File* in your Overwatch settings. This setting can be found here:

Once this is enabled, use the [ScrimTime workshop code](https://workshop.codes/DKEEH) to 
gather the logs. Turn on `Enable Log Generator` in Workshop Settings. The logs will be 
exported to your `Documents/Overwatch/Workshop` folder. It is recommended to make sure 
you delete any logs that are only 1kb; incomplete logs can be generated which does not 
work well with Parsertime.

### What stats are collected?
By default, the following stats are collected:
- Match Start & End
- Round Start & End
- Objective Captures
- Control Point Progress Increment
- Payload Progress Increment
- Kills & Deaths
- Offensive & Defensive Assists
- Hero Spawn
- Hero Swaps
- Ultimates Charged & Used
- D.Va Demechs & Remechs
- D.Va Remech Charged
- Echo Duplicates
- Mercy Resurrects
- Player Stat Summary

We are able to visualize these stats for each map.

## Uploading Scrim Logs
Once you are signed in, you can create and upload new scrims from the dashboard. Click 
the button labeled `Create Scrim`. Add a title, assign a team, pick a date, and upload 
the logs for the first map (you can add the rest later). 

### Common Errors
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This documentation is a work in progress. Not all errors are documented here. 
    If you have any questions, please reach out to us 
    on [Discord](https://discord.gg/svz3qhVDXM) or send us an email at
    [help@parsertime.app](mailto:help@parsertime.app).

#### Invalid Log Format (500)
If you try to create the scrim and see an `Invalid Log Format (500)` error, try to search 
through the logs and see if any of the stats are appearing as `****`. Sometimes, the log 
generator runs into issues and cannot correctly add the stats. If this happens, replace 
the stat with the number you believe is accurate. Once you reupload the logs, the scrim 
should create successfully.

#### Internal Server Error (500)
If you see this error, it is likely that the mistake is on our end. Please reach out to
us via email or Discord and we will help you resolve the issue. You can find us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/svz3qhVDXM) or by emailing us at 
[help@parsertime.app](mailto:help@parsertime.app).

#### Unauthorized (401)
If you see this error, it is likely that your session has expired. Try logging out and
back in. If the issue persists, please reach out to us via email or Discord and we will
help you resolve the issue. You can find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/svz3qhVDXM)
or by emailing us at [help@parsertime.app](mailto:help@parsertime.app).

Another reason you may see this error is if you are trying to upload a map to a scrim
created for a team that you are not a manager of. If you are a manager of the team, try
logging out and back in. If the issue persists, please reach out to us for further 
assistance.
