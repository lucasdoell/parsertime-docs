# Introduction
 
Welcome to Parsertime! This is the home for our documentation. Here you 
can learn more about our platform, how to use it, and more.

## What is Parsertime?
Parsertime is a tool used to visualize the data collected from Overwatch 
scrim logs. You can create an account, form a team, upload your scrims, and 
invite your team to view their data. You can see graphs for damage, eliminations, 
fights, and view data and statistics for both teams and individual players. 

## Collecting Scrim Logs
To gather your data, you must first turn on *Gameplay > Enable Workshop Inspector 
Log File* in your Overwatch settings. This setting can be found here:

Once this is enabled, use the [ScrimTime workshop code](https://workshop.codes/DKEEH) to 
gather the logs. Turn on `Enable Log Generator` in Workshop Settings. The logs will be 
exported to your `Documents/Overwatch/Workshop` folder. It is recommended to make sure 
you delete any logs that are only 1kb; incomplete logs can be generated which does not 
work well with Parsertime.

### What stats are collected?
By default, the following stats are collected:
- Match Start & End
- Round Start & End
- Objective Captures
- Control Point Progress Increment
- Payload Progress Increment
- Kills & Deaths
- Offensive & Defensive Assists
- Hero Spawn
- Hero Swaps
- Ultimates Charged & Used
- D.Va Demechs & Remechs
- D.Va Remech Charged
- Echo Duplicates
- Mercy Resurrects
- Player Stat Summary

We are able to visualize these stats for each map.

## Uploading Scrim Logs
Once you are signed in, you can create and upload new scrims from the dashboard. Click 
the button labeled `Create Scrim`. Add a title, assign a team, pick a date, and upload 
the logs for the first map (you can add the rest later). 
### Common Errors:
If you try to create the scrim and see a `500` error, check the logs for `****`s. 
Sometimes, the log generator runs into issues and cannot correctly add the stats. If this 
happens, replace the stat with the number you believe is accurate. Once you reupload the 
logs, the scrim should create successfully.
