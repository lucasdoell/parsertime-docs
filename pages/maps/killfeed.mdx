# Killfeed

The killfeed is a recreation of the in-game killfeed, showing each
kill and death that occurs during the map. It shows the time of the
kill, the attacking player, the victim player, the method of the kill,
and information about the fight the kill belongs to. The killfeed is
grouped into fights. 

<Callout type="info">
    Fights are determined by finding each kill and
    grouping them together based on the time between kills. If a kill happens within
    15 seconds of another kill, it is considered part of the same fight. If a kill
    happens more than 15 seconds after the last kill, it is considered a new fight.
</Callout>

The killfeed is useful for understanding the flow of the map and
how each team is performing. It can show which players are getting
kills, which players are dying, and how fights are unfolding. By
analyzing the killfeed, you can see which team is winning fights 
and which players are making the biggest impact.

## Overview Stats

The killfeed shows the following stats above the list of kills:

- **Total Match Time**: The total time of the match.
- **Total Kills**: The total number of kills for each team that occurred during the match.
- **Total Deaths**: The total number of deaths for each team that occurred during the match.
- **Fight Wins**: The total number of fights won by each team.

These stats give an overview of how the map is progressing and
which team is performing better. By looking at the total kills and
deaths, you can see which team is getting more kills and which team
is dying more. The fight wins stat shows which team is winning more
fights and gaining the upper hand in the map.
