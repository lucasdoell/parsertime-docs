# Overview

The map overview is the default view for each map. It shows basic information
such as the total match time, the final score, the hero damage dealt by each team,
and the team healing dealt. The overview also shows the stats table for each
player, which includes stats like eliminations, deaths, and damage dealt. There
is also an analysis section that contains information such as the team's first
death percentage, which team got the most value out of their ultimates, and which
player had the most first deaths. If a player played Lúcio and got their ultimate
cancelled, it will be listed as an Ajax in the analysis section.

## Basic Stats

The basic stats section shows the total match time, the final score of the map, 
the hero damage dealt by each team, and the team healing dealt. This section
gives you a quick overview of how the map went and which team came out on top.
Generally, the team with the most hero damage dealt tends to win the map, but
there are exceptions to this rule.

<Callout type="warning">
    Due to limitations with the Workshop, the final score is NOT able to be 
    tracked for Push maps. The final score will be displayed as "N/A". This
    is a known issue and is being tracked on the [Known Issues](/known-issues)
    page.
</Callout>

### Total Match Time

The total match time is the amount of time that the map took to complete. This
is measured by the Workshop and does not include any time spent in the lobby
or in between rounds. The total match time is important because it can help
you determine hero stats per 10 minutes, which can be useful for comparing
players on the same hero.

### Final Score

The final score is the score that each team achieved on the map. This is
important because it shows which team won the map. The final score is calculated
differently for each map type.

The calculation for Control looks like this:

```sql
CASE Control
  -- Determine winner by comparing scores of both teams
  IF finalRound.team_1_score > finalRound.team_2_score THEN
    RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
  ELSE
    RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
  ENDIF
```

This is the most basic calculation for determining the winner of a map. The
winner is determined by comparing the scores of both teams and seeing which
team scored more points. The team with the most points wins the map.

The calculation for Escort looks like this:

```sql
CASE Escort
  -- Evaluate win based on captures; if none, other team wins
  IF team1Captures HAS NO ELEMENTS THEN
    RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
  ENDIF
  IF team2Captures HAS NO ELEMENTS THEN
    RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
  ENDIF
  
  -- If both teams have captures, compare last capture times remaining
  IF team1Captures.length EQUALS team2Captures.length THEN
    IF team1Captures[last index].match_time_remaining > team2Captures[last index].match_time_remaining THEN
      RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
    ELSE
      RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
    ENDIF
  ELSE
    -- Otherwise, the team with more captures wins
    IF team1Captures.length > team2Captures.length THEN
      RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
    ELSE
      RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
```

This calculation is a bit more complex than the Control calculation. The winner
is determined by comparing the number of captures that each team has. If one
team has more captures than the other, they win the map. If both teams have
the same number of captures, the team with the most time remaining on their
last capture wins the map. This is important because it shows which team was
able to push the payload the furthest in the least amount of time. This can
be a good indicator of which team was able to work together and push the
payload as a team.

The calculation for Flashpoint looks like this:

```sql
CASE Flashpoint
  -- Similar to Control, winner determined by team scores
  IF finalRound.team_1_score > finalRound.team_2_score THEN
    RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
  ELSE
    RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
  ENDIF
```

This calculation is similar to the Control calculation. The winner is determined
by comparing the scores of both teams and seeing which team scored more points.
The team with the most points wins the map.

The calculation for Hybrid looks like this:

```sql
CASE Hybrid
  -- Similar logic to Escort but considers capture existence
  IF team1Captures IS NOT DEFINED THEN
    RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
  ENDIF
  IF team2Captures IS NOT DEFINED THEN
    RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
  ENDIF
  
  IF team1Captures.length EQUALS team2Captures.length THEN
    IF team1Captures[last index].match_time_remaining > team2Captures[last index].match_time_remaining THEN
      RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
    ELSE
      RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
    ENDIF
  ELSE
    IF team1Captures.length > team2Captures.length THEN
      RETURN matchDetails.team_1_name
    ELSE
      RETURN matchDetails.team_2_name
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
```

This calculation is similar to the Escort calculation. Due to
the nature of Hybrid combining a first point capture and a payload push,
the winner is determined by comparing the number of captures that each team
has. If one team has more captures than the other, they win the map. If both
teams have the same number of captures, the team with the most time remaining
on their last capture wins the map.

The calculation for Push looks like this:

```sql
CASE Push
  -- Push map type does not calculate winner due to Workshop limitations
  RETURN "N/A"
```

Unfortunately, the Push map type does not have a calculation for determining
the winner. This is a known issue and is being tracked on the [Known Issues](/known-issues)
page. This is due to the Workshop not tracking the Push objective as a capture
or payload progress. The final score will be displayed as "N/A" until this
issue is resolved.

There are edge cases where the final score may not accurately reflect the
winner of the map. If this happens, please reach out to us so we can investigate
the issue further.

<Callout type="info">
    All calculations shown are in pseudocode and are not the actual code used
    to determine the final score. The actual code is more complex. You can
    find the implementation [here](https://github.com/luxdotdev/parsertime/blob/6d96055a8fbc702f8abdef5da877180286250b58/src/components/map/default-overview.tsx#L101).

### Hero Damage Dealt

The hero damage dealt is the total amount of damage that each team dealt to
the enemy team. The amount of damage is an indicator of the value and pressure
being applied by each team. The team with the most hero damage dealt tends to
win the map, but there are exceptions to this rule.

### Team Healing Dealt

The team healing dealt is the total amount of healing that each team provided
to their teammates. The amount of healing is an indicator of the sustain and
survivability of each team. The team with the most team healing dealt is often
the losing team due to taking more damage and needing more healing. However,
this is not always the case and can vary depending on the team compositions
and playstyles.

## Player Stats Table

The player stats table shows the stats for each player on the map. The following stats
are included in the table:

- Player Name
- Role
- Player Team
- Time Played
- Eliminations
- Final Blows
- Assists
- Deaths
- K/D Ratio
- KA/D Ratio
- Hero Damage Dealt
- Damage Received
- Healing Received 
- Healing Dealt 
- Damage Dealt/Healing Received Ratio
- Ultimates Charged
- Ultimates Used

Here is a photo of the player stats table:

![Player Stats Table](/maps/overview-table.png)
*A view of the player stats table for a map.*

The table is sorted by team and then by role. For example, team 1 is listed
before team 2 and the roles are listed in the following order: Damage, Tank,
Support. This makes it easier to compare players on the same team and role.
The players in each role are sorted alphabetically by player name. This makes
it easier to find a specific player and see how they performed on the map.

The table columns are both hoverable and sortable. You can hover over a column
header to see a description of what the column represents. You can also click
on a column header to sort the table by that column. This makes it easier to
find the information you are looking for and compare players on different stats.

### Player Name

The player name column shows the name of each player that participated in the map.

<Callout type="info">
    The player name is a clickable link that will take you to the individual
    stats page for that player. This allows you to see how that player performed
    on the map.

## Analysis

The analysis section contains information about the map that can help you
understand how the map went and what you can improve on. The following
information is included in the analysis section:

- First Death Percentage
- Ultimate Value
- First Deaths
- Ajaxes (Optional)

Here are two examples of the analysis section:

![Analysis Section](/maps/analysis.png)
*A view of the analysis section for a map. This includes an example of an Ajax.*

![Analysis without Ajaxes](/maps/analysis-no-ajax.png)
*A view of the analysis section without Ajaxes for a map.*

The Ajax section is conditional and will only be displayed if a player played
Lúcio and had their ultimate cancelled. This can be a rare occurrence and is
not always present in the analysis section.

### What is an Ajax?

An Ajax is a term used to describe when a player (typically Lúcio) has their
ultimate ability interupted or cancelled during its cast due to being stunned,
hacked, or killed. The term is a reference to Ajax, a Contenders player who played
for Atlanta Academy. He was known for dying mid-beat and losing his ultimate.

### First Death Percentage

The first death percentage is the percentage of fights where a specific team
had one of their players die first. First deaths are very impactful in Overwatch
because they can lead to a team fight loss and a snowball effect. The team with
the lowest first death percentage tends to win the map because they are able
to stay alive longer, control more space, assert more pressure, and get more value.

The first death percentage is calculated by counting the number of fights where
a specific team had one of their players die first and dividing that by the total
number of fights. This gives you a percentage that shows how often a team is
losing the first player in a fight.

<Callout type="info">
    Fights are determined by finding each kill and
    grouping them together based on the time between kills. If a kill happens within
    15 seconds of another kill, it is considered part of the same fight. If a kill
    happens more than 15 seconds after the last kill, it is considered a new fight.
</Callout>

### Ultimate Value

The ultimate value is a metric that shows which team got the most value out of
their ultimates. Ultimates are impactful abilities that can turn the tide of a
fight. Not getting value out of an ultimate can be detrimental to a team and
can lead to a lost fight. This metric shows which team got more kills as a result
of their ultimates.

### First Deaths

The first deaths section shows which player had the most first deaths on the map.
This metric is valuable because it shows which player is dying first in fights
most often. If there is an outlier, it can be a sign that the player is out of
position, not getting enough support, or not playing with their team. This can
be a good indicator of where a team needs to improve and what they need to focus
on in future maps.
