## Events Timeline

The events timeline shows a timeline of the events that occurred throughout the map.
Each event is listed with a timestamp and a description of what happened. The events
are color-coded based on the team that the event occurred for. Team 1 events are shown
in blue, and Team 2 events are shown in red.

This timeline is useful for understanding the key moments that occurred throughout the map.
For example, in the above Events timeline, we can see that Spingar killed two players with
their ultimate at 2:34. This information can help you find where this event occurred in the
replay viewer and analyze how it impacted the map.

There are special events that are tracked on the Events timeline, such as Ajaxes. Ajaxes are
a special event that occurs when a Lúcio player dies during the cast of their ultimate ability.

This information can help you find important blunders that occurred during the map and analyze
how they can be avoided in the future.

## Ultimate Timeline

The Events page also shows an Ultimate timeline that shows when each player used their ultimate
ability throughout the map. The Ultimate timeline is color-coded based on the team that the player
is on. Team 1 players are shown in blue, and Team 2 players are shown in red.

![Ultimates Used](/maps/ultimates-used.png)
*An example of the Ultimate timeline showing when each player used their ultimate ability throughout the map.*

This timeline is useful for understanding when each player used their ultimate ability. This can help
detect if a player is using their ultimate ability too early or too late and can help you analyze how
the ultimate ability usage impacted the map. This is also useful for finding if a player is using their
ultimate ability too often or not enough.
